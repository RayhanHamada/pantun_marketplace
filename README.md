In Upin Ipin S15E22 (Rajin Menyimpan Bijak Belanja), there's a scene where Upin Ipin's friends chilling in a small shack and each of them showing off their source of income,

<br />
Ehsan with his video content making...

<br />
Mei mei helping her mother selling flowers...

<br />
Susanti also helping her mother baking cakes and pastries...

<br />
Mail that hustlin' everyday selling chickens and stuff... (mad respect on this dude)

<br />
And Fizi <strike>with his sugar baby mentality</strike> that always assist his friend ehsan

<br />
But how is JARJIT ?

<br />
He GOT his STUFF, but NO MARKET...

<br />
Therefore, NONE TO BE SELL.
